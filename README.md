# VisMotive-BuiltBinary

<br/>
I provide built files of VisMotove essential componenets (Core APIs and certain essential module DLLs). Header and library files are provided for simple developement of VisMotive-based applications. Someday, I will open all source codes of these DLL files with build environments. The only problem for this is .. time (I am so busy for other projects and paper writings..). If anyone has experience this release work, please help me up!    

### Platforms:
